AlgoViz


Welcome to AlgoViz, an interactive program designed to help users understand sorting algorithms through entertaining animations.

Introduction


AlgoViz is a Java-based interactive tool that visualizes various sorting algorithms, providing users with a hands-on way to learn and explore how algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and others work in real-time. Whether you're new to programming or a seasoned developer, AlgoViz offers an intuitive graphical interface to observe and understand sorting processes step-by-step.

Features


Interactive Animations: Watch sorting algorithms come to life with engaging visualizations.

Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Choose from a variety of algorithms including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

Real-Time Visualization: Experience sorting algorithms in action, with each step animated on the graphical display.

Adjustable Speed: Control the speed of the animations to suit your learning pace. 

Getting Started


To get started with AlgoViz, follow these steps:
clone it 
Open the Project: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to open the project.

Run the Application: Locate the main Java file and run the application. This will launch the AlgoViz GUI.

How to Use


Launch the Application: Upon starting AlgoViz, you will be presented with the interactive sorting visualization GUI.

Select an Algorithm: Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort).

Adjust Animation Speed: Use the speed control feature to set the animation pace.

Visualize Sorting: Click on the "Visualize" button to initiate the sorting process. Observe the algorithm's execution in real-time on the graphical display.

Explore and Learn: After sorting completion, experiment with different algorithms or modify input data to further explore sorting concepts.
